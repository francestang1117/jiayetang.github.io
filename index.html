				<p>Crafted vital components, including the Java-based Forwarding Gateway Adapter, contributing to
					product profitability.</p>
				<p>Implemented the Metering stack to collect monitoring data for Prometheus and Grafana, achieving
					performance optimization and observability. Made substantial contributions to Quota Management and
					Lifecycle Management.</p>
				<p>Specialized in credential rotation across multiple cloud platforms (AliCloud, GCP, OpenStack).
					Leveraged the power of Python scripting in conjunction with a robust blue-green logic approach to
					optimize the credential rotation process, thereby ensuring both security and efficiency.
					This involved maintaining two sets of credentials during the rotation process. Before retiring the
					old set of credentials, a custom Python script was meticulously crafted to establish connections
					with the respective cloud services. The script's primary objectives were to create new credentials,
					validate their correctness,
					and securely store the verified credentials in a designated vault. Once the storage process was
					confirmed to be successful, a subsequent step was initiated to delete the older credentials. This
					careful orchestration of credential rotation not only ensured the highest level of security but also
					significantly improved the overall efficiency of
					the system by eliminating potential security vulnerabilities and minimizing downtime associated with
					credential changes.
				</p>
				<P>Executed comprehensive testing of credential rotation logic within virtual instances before
					deployment to the cloud, ensuring flawless functionality.</P>
				<P>Orchestrated and automated complex pipelines with precision and efficiency by crafting Jenkinsfiles
					using Groovy. These Jenkinsfiles served as the backbone of our automated processes, orchestrating
					the entire workflow seamlessly. This included tasks such as obtaining Docker images, executing
					intricate Python scripts,
					and sending messages to dedicated Slack channels. The Groovy Jenkinsfiles, meticulously tailored to
					our specific requirements, played a pivotal role in achieving a highly streamlined and automated
					workflow. These files encompassed a multi-step process designed to simplify every facet of our
					operations.
					Also, messages and updates were seamlessly relayed to dedicated Slack channels, keeping the entire
					team informed about the progress of operations and any potential issues.
				</P>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Vigorously monitored and managed the daily influx of operational tickets,
					meticulously ensuring the smooth workflow and maintaining optimal system performance. This involved
					a proactive and comprehensive approach to ticket management, focusing on key aspects:</p>
				<P style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daily Ticket Assessment:</span> Each day
					commenced with a thorough evaluation of incoming tickets. This involved a meticulous review of the
					ticketing system to identify any new or ongoing issues. The commitment to addressing these concerns
					proactively was a core part of our strategy.</P>
				<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pipeline and Cluster Health Checks:</span>
					A pivotal element of my daily routine was the diligent inspection of all operational pipelines and
					clusters. This comprehensive assessment aimed to confirm that these vital components of the
					infrastructure were functioning at their peak. Any discrepancies were promptly identified and
					rectified, preventing potential bottlenecks and outages.</p>
				<P><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Ticket Resolution:</span> Addressing tickets was more than
					just a routine task; it was a mission to ensure the seamless operation of the systems. I harnessed
					my expertise in error message analysis and logs generated by the pipelines and clusters. These
					invaluable resources served as my guiding light, enabling me to swiftly pinpoint and resolve issues.
					The ability to correlate error messages and logs to specific problems was pivotal in the success.

				<p>As a team member in the "Trivia Game" project, I actively contributed to the development of a unique
					online trivia game, which consists of several modules. Specifically, I was responsible for the "Team
					Chat" and "In Game Experience" parts. This project enables players to form teams and engage in
					real-time competition. Hosted on multiple cloud servers for accessibility and reliability, it offers
					a personalized gaming experience. The game adapts to each player's strengths and preferences,
					delivering tailored questions. Additionally, players can track their performance on various
					leaderboards, fostering a sense of accomplishment and friendly global competition.</p>
				<p>During my involvement in the project, I leveraged the power of Firebase's Firestore and real-time
					database to enhance various features. For the chat functionality, I harnessed the real-time
					database, storing data as JSON and enabling seamless synchronization in real time for all connected
					clients. The real-time database excels in handling instantaneous events, making it a perfect fit for
					chat messages. This allowed me to effortlessly monitor real-time changes in the database and
					promptly receive updates on the frontend. This is particularly vital in applications where
					delivering messages instantly is a priority.</p>
				<P>Compared to other options, like DynamoDB, Firebase's real-time database stood out. It organizes data
					in documents, making it highly intuitive and facilitating my work. Hence, I chose Firebase's
					real-time database to create the chat feature.</P>
				<P>In addition to the chat feature, I played a significant role in developing the game features. I
					contributed to the functionality that display questions, time alert, tracks team and user
					performance.
					This involved retriving questions based on category and difficulty determined by users, fetching
					user
					and team data, querying the information, and ranking it based on scores in descending order. These
					efforts combined my technical expertise with a keen sense of user experience to ensure a seamless
					and enjoyable gaming adventure.</P>

				<p>This project leverages AWS cloud services to deliver timely news updates and sentiment analysis.
					Users input their preferences through a user-friendly React frontend, and the system does the rest.
					AWS Lambda functions fetch news articles, analyze them for sentiment using AWS Comprehend, store the
					data in DynamoDB, and trigger email notifications through AWS SNS. The entire application is hosted
					on AWS, ensuring seamless integration and high scalability.</p>
				<p>In this project, I designed and deployed a React-based front-end, hosting it on an AWS EC2 instance.
					This orchestration of the front-end seamlessly interacts with the backend, which I managed and
					provisioned with AWS CloudFormation, ensuring a robust and secure foundation.</p>
				<P>To handle incoming user requests, I integrated AWS API Gateway, creating a streamlined path for user
					interactions. Behind the scenes, AWS Lambda played a crucial role in the serverless logic that
					powers the system, managing tasks like fetching news from external sources and conducting sentiment
					analysis, all in a scalable and efficient manner.</P>
				<p>Data is at the heart of our system, and I chose AWS DynamoDB for its capabilities in providing
					scalable and high-performance data storage. Additionally, I ensured that project files are securely
					stored in AWS S3, guaranteeing easy access and efficient management.</p>
				<p>For the critical task of sentiment analysis, I harnessed the power of AWS Comprehend, enabling the
					system to interpret and analyze the sentiment conveyed in news articles. To keep users informed in
					real-time, AWS SNS was employed for email notifications, ensuring users receive the latest updates
					at
					their convenience.</p>

				<P>In my role as a team member responsible for backend development, I played a pivotal role in shaping
					the EMAT app. Key responsibilities included the design and development of EMAT app APIs using Python
					Flask.</P>
				<p>For the app's core functionality, I designed and implemented user registration, login, and logout
					APIs. These APIs were integrated with MongoDB to ensure data integrity and security. To handle user
					authentication and authorization, Flask JWT tokens were employed.</p>
				<p>Another significant aspect of my work was the development of currency-related APIs. These APIs
					allowed users to access currency details in real-time, enhancing their experience. MongoDB was used
					to manage and store accurate currency information.</p>
				<p>To empower users to manage their profiles effectively, I also designed and implemented
					profile-related APIs, enabling users to access and update their profile information.</p>
				<p>Collaboration and testing the APIs were integral parts of my contribution. I actively collaborated
					with the team, ensuring the APIs' functionality and performance. I also participated in strategic
					discussions, contributing to the project's direction and objectives.</p>

				<p>In this project, I took on a central role as the lead developer and researcher, contributing
					significantly to the codebase. The primary objective was to conduct sentiment analysis focusing on
					Twitter data and examine its correlation with the stock prices of Apple Inc.</p>
				<P><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Preprocessing:</span> I spearheaded the data
					preprocessing efforts, employing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to clean and prepare the
					textual data for analysis. This step involved tasks such as text tokenization, stop-word removal,
					and more to ensure the quality of the dataset.</P>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sentiment Analysis:</span> To gauge sentiment, I employed sentiment
					analysis tools, including VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and AFINN. This
					helped in labeling the tweets with sentiment scores, allowing for subsequent sentiment-based
					investigations.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correlation Analysis:</span> I conducted an in-depth exploration of
					the correlation between sentiment expressed in Apple-related tweets and the corresponding stock
					prices. Spearman Correlation was used to measure this relationship, providing valuable insights into
					how public sentiment might influence the stock market.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Machine Learning Models:</span> Leveraging my expertise, I
					constructed machine learning models, specifically Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
					models, tailored for sentiment classification. These models played a pivotal role in automating
					sentiment analysis and classification processes.</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance Evaluation:</span> To ensure the reliability and
					effectiveness of the sentiment classification models, I meticulously evaluated their performance
					using key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. This comprehensive assessment
					was essential in fine-tuning the models for optimal results.</p>
